# TempoGaze
---
In this project, we seek to estimate the duration and location of the gaze. We propose an interdisciplinary model by taking advantage of deep learning and decision-making models. 

> Deep learning models: 
1.  CNN
2.  Resnet
3.  GANs
4.  Diffusion models

> Decision models:
1.  Reflected distribution
2.  WALD distribution
